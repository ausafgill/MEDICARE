Project description. Developed a versatile Medicare app with multi-level authorization for patients, pharmacies, companies, and transporters. Pharmacies can upload medicines, companies can list medical equipment, and patients can purchase these products directly. Transporters offer delivery services, while an admin account manages all profiles. This app ensures seamless healthcare management and accessibility, streamlining the process for all users involved.
